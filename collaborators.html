                                        <p>I’m Mike (he/him/his), a professor at the University of Chicago, and the
                                            originator of both the Sloan Giant Arcs Survey (SGAS) and COOL-LAMPS. My
                                            research is discovery oriented - in the early parts of my career I focused
                                            on the discovery of large numbers of distant galaxy clusters and using them
                                            to measure cosmological parameters. In the past decade I have segued to
                                            focusing on the smaller subset of massive structures that act as strong
                                            lenses, using such systems to study both the background universe, and the
                                            foreground lens distribution. I’m grateful that in my work I have been able
                                            to collaborate with extraordinary people, and that I’ve been able to build
                                            abiding friendships with research as a common thread; the communal process
                                            of discovery that results feeds my happiness!</p>

                                            I’m originally from the Northwest suburbs of Chicago, and I got a BS in
                                            Astrophysics from UChicago in 2020. In undergrad, my research primarily
                                            focused on gravitational lensing and galaxies with Prof. Mike Gladders while
                                            also dabbling in machine learning and neural networks with Dr. Brian Nord.
                                            Now in grad school I’m working on galaxy mergers and stellar halos with
                                            Prof. Eric Bell, currently studying the spiral galaxy M94. I love doing
                                            astronomy outreach and frequently volunteer with a STEAM education

                                            COOL-LAMPS collaboration in 2020, where I did work with the DeCALS survey
                                            and spectral reduction. My current research interests include human-robot
                                            interaction, computer vision, and speech processing!</p>

                                        <p>I am a student in the UChicago Class of 2022 studying astrophysics and
                                            economics. I am really interested in dark matter, galaxy formation and
                                            cosmology. I am interested in the COOL-LAMPS project because it one of pure
                                            exploration and trying to find objects that no other human has observed
                                            before. A fun fact is that I am from Florida but I love cold weather.

                                        <p>I am an astrophysics major in the UChicago Class of 2022 with various
                                            research interests including cosmology and spectroscopy currently, but I
                                            have found that pretty much anything astrophysics related excites me, so at
                                            this point I am in no hurry to narrow down my options yet. In my free time
                                            you’ll find me playing soccer and exploring nature with friends, with the
                                            beach being the primary spot for both of these activities. My ultimate goal
                                            in my eventual astrophysics career is just to have the opportunity to
                                            research in an area that never ceases to excite me. I can’t ask for much
                                            better than that.

                                            type galaxies that we have discovered during our searches. I love taking

                                            galaxy we discovered in our lens search. We're characterizing its morphology
                                            to understand more about early-type galaxy evolution. In my free time, I

                                            COOL-LAMPS I do near-field cosmology research. I love playing and following

                                            years and soccer for a long time before that. In the evenings, I enjoy

                                        <p>I’m Kate (she/her), a PhD Candidate in Astronomy at the University of
                                            Michigan working with Professor Keren Sharon. My research focuses on strong
                                            gravitational lensing. With COOL-LAMPS, I am particularly interested in
                                            studying quasars lensed by galaxy clusters. I greatly enjoy observing and
                                            have experience with the Magellan Telescopes. In addition to astronomy, I
                                            love ballet, art, scuba diving, and the outdoors.</p>
