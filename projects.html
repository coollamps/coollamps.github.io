						<p>We share the discovery of COOL-J1241+2219, a lensed galaxy at z =
							5.04
							that is the brightest galaxy known at z > 5. This galaxy and the
							cluster
							lens were discovered as part of the COOL-LAMPS project — ChicagO
							Optically-selected
							strong Lenses - Located At the Margins of Public Surveys —
							initiated to find
							strongly lensed systems in recent ground-based public imaging
							survey data,
							consisting primarily of a team of undergraduate students. </p>
						<p>COOL-J1241+2219 is five times brighter than the prior record-holder
							at these redshifts,
							at zAB = 20.5. We characterize the lensed galaxy, as well as the
							brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) of
							the lens cluster (at z=1.00), using ground-based grizJH band
							photometry and
							rest-frame UV and optical spectroscopy. We use stellar
							population synthesis
							(SPS) modeling to characterize galaxy properties such as the
							stellar mass and
							star formation rate in the lensed galaxy. Using COOL-J1241+2219
							as an anchor,
							we discuss the distribution of bright and lensed galaxies at z >
							5.

							<h2> COOL-LAMPS II. Multi-wavelength characterization of COOL

							<p>We present COOL J1323+0343, an early-type galaxy at z=1.0153, strongly 
								lensed by a cluster of galaxies at z = z=0.353. This object was 
								originally imaged by DECaLS and noted as a gravitational lens by COOL-LAMPS, 
								and confirmed with follow-up data. With ground-based grzH imaging 
								and optical spectroscopy from the Las Campanas Observatory and the 
								Nordic Optical Telescope, we derive a stellar mass, metallicity, and 
								star-formation history from stellar-population synthesis modeling. The 
								lens modeling implies a total magnification of μ∼113. The median remnant 
								stellar mass in the source plane is 10.63 solar masses and the median star-formation 
								rate in the source plane is 1.55×10−3 solar masses/yr in 
								the youngest two age bins (0-100 Myr, closest to the epoch of observation_. 
								Our measurements place COOL J1323+0343 below the characteristic mass of the 
								stellar mass function, making it an especially compelling target that could 
								help clarify how intermediate mass quiescent galaxies evolve. We reconstruct 
								COOL J1323+0343 in the source plane and fit its light profile. This object is 
								below the expected size-evolution of early-type galaxy at this mass with an 
								effective radius ~ 0.5 kpc. This extraordinarily magnified and bright lensed 
								early-type galaxy offers an exciting opportunity to study the morphology and 
								star formation history of an intermediate mass early-type galaxy in detail at z∼1 .
